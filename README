One way sync tool from iCalendar (ics file) to Google Calendar.
Takes a .ics file as parameter, adds it to Google Calendar.

Calendar properties to be synchronized:
       - Event summary (title)
       - Event date/time (start and end)
       
CURRENTLY, ONLY JST (JAPN) TIME ZONE is supported. 
(because of a hard-coded hack to fix timezone problem with iCalendar library)

Prerequisite:
1. Setup your Google Developer API 
   https://console.developers.google.com/
2. Setup your OAuth credentials for this script
   https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/firstapp
   - create your client id and secret for native applications
   - download client_secret (json file) 
   - put it to the same folder of the script
3. Run the script
   (First time, you will see OAuth consent screen on your browser)

Usage: ics2gcal [options] ics_file
    -g CALENDAR      Name of Google Calendar to be synchronized
    -x CATEGORIES    Comma seperated list of categories that will not be sync
